feat(gatling-js): Implement Java interop for setup and refactor URLs/scenarios

- Implemented Java interop via GraalVM to execute setup code before scenarios.
- Refactored URLs to be stored as global variables (using .env.json).
- Refactored test scenarios for explicit test data and assertions.
- Prepared project structure for future work on a `before` hook equivalent.
